In this documentation, we present our project Decentralized marketplace and the related findings. Marketplace is a directory service in which users can search for the desired application. It is similar to Google play store, Apple app store and Microsoft store. Usually design of marketplace assumes that the marketplace functions are performed by intermediaries in a centralized environment, controlling the whole ecosystem. Decentralized marketplace proposes the concept of complete decentralization. It is a directory service for Identities, Applications and API's which brings out an idea of trust less inter-mediation to facilitate new forms of decentralized service marketplace. The implementation of this project is based on blockchain using the core feature of smart contract provided by Ethereum.
